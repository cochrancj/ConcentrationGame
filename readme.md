A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jquery

Approach Taken: I started from a place of having all images in arrays, and went from there. I created a bunch of cards, shuffled the cards, shot those to the board one by one, and compared from there.

Installation Instructions: ??

Unsolved Problems: 

  - I wanted to add a timer to tell you how long you are taking to play the game

  - I wanted to make The Cheat carom around the board

  - I wanted to give the option to select two or three different decks

  - I need to refactor my code so it is not such a jumbled mess, but ran up against a wall with operation order

  - I also need to refactor how I'm building the board to take up less power - if I make the board and *then* shoot that to the DOM, it would be much more efficient than shooting 20 items to the DOM.
